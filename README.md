# Structure-aware-interactive-Recommender-System---Python---Reinforcement-Learning

## Applied an improved reinforcement learning (DQN) to deliver a more interactive recommender system. As the previous recommender systems failed to consider personal interest change causing continuous recommendation of similar items to user, the new system allowed a higher accuracy for shifts in personal preferences. The final precision on MovieLens achieved around 20%.
